Android TTS OCR Converter (Mobile App)- A Mobile Assistive Tool for Text-to-Speech and Chatbot Interaction

This project introduces an Android mobile application—Android TTS OCR Converter—that is geared towards visually impaired, elderly, and dyslexic users by converting printed text to speech. The system has integrated CameraX, ML Kit OCR, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and OpenAI's chatbot API to facilitate on-the-fly text recognition, auditory feedback, and contextual communication.

Through intuitive volume key operation and sound cues, users are able to capture text, listen to speech output, and operate chatbot support without requiring screen navigation. The app is focused on independence and accessibility through a low-cost and portable assistive option.
It highlights on OCR accuracy, TTS audibility, chatbots' response quality, and user ratings. The findings indicate that the system effectively enhances target users' information access and gives a good foundation for its possible future extension.

All system prompts and voice interactions are provided in Chinese, in keeping with the app’s local (HK) user base.
